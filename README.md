# EclipseRAP-E4-Application
This small project is intended to provide a predefined Eclipse RAP E4 application that may be used as a blueprint for other. 
The actual application is very small and just contains an application model (Application.e4xmi) and a single view (part). 
Main focus was set to the structure that should allow to test developments locally and deploy an RAP application to a servlet container (e.g. for Tomcat or Wildfly/JBoss). For building the application (*.war-file) the maven-tycho plugin is used.

The project is currently under development and serves as discussion base.
